Pokemon App

This is a React project that fetches data from the Pokemon API and displays Pokemons on the screen. The project includes several notable features such as pagination, filtering, routing, and Redux.
Features

    Pagination: Users can navigate through different pages and select a number from the dropdown menu to quickly go to that page.
    Filtering: Users can filter Pokemons by their type, sort them with their name or ID number, and filter with their names using the input area. Users can also change the displayed picture between static and animated images for Pokemons and reset all filtering and sorting.
    Routing: React Router is used for routing in the project.
    Redux: The project uses Redux for state management.
    Authentication: Users can create a profile with their email and password, and log in to their account. Once the token expires, the user will automatically log out. Otherwise, the token is stored in the browser.
    Favorite Pokemons: Users can add Pokemons to their favorite list after logging in. They can see and organize their favorite Pokemons through the favorites page.
    User Settings: Users can change their email and password from the settings page. They can also delete their favorite Pokemons list or their account completely.
    Responsive Design: The project is responsive for all screen sizes, from small mobile phones to computer screens.
    Customizable Message Box: A customizable message box is present, so different messages can be shown to the user as needed.
    Detailed Pokemon Card: When clicked on a Pokemon card, a detailed and bigger Pokemon card appears on top of everything. It includes more detailed Pokemon image, brief summary about the Pokemon, and evolutions that the Pokemon can evolve to or evolve from.
    Firebase: Firebase is used for storing and authentication operations.
    Page is filled with pokemons after every page size change, so there is no empty line at the end. Each row have the exact same number of pokemon.
