## Why this project?

I was looking for an idea to make a frontend project and then I came across [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
It is a full RESTful API linked to an extensive database detailing everything about the Pokémon main game series.
I decided to do this project because of the extensive data it provided and
also because it made me feel nostalgic. Working on this project was a fun experience.</br>

### Some Notes

- Big majority of the pokemons have only one or two evolution forms. But some pokemons doesn't follow a linear line of evolution chain. They evolve to different pokemons in a different conditions. For example one of the pokemons can evolve into 8 different ones depending on the stone type he is holding. Their numbers in total pokemons were very small, so I didn't change the project for them. Their evolution information is not wrong but missing some data.
- I didn't include all the pokemons from the api because I didn't quite like new ones. I decided it would be fine even if I don't include 21 meter long Gigantamax Pikachu to the project when I already got 890 pokemon to display.
- Only first 649 pokemon have animated picture available. This is because the images were not produced after that point. Therefore, animated images doesnt exist for rest of the pokemons.
